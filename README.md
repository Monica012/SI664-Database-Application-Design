# Restaurant Reservation Database Project

The restaurant reservation system maintains the catalog for different kinds of restaurants that can be reserved. Users can view their reservation history. A friend list is also provided, and users can see their friends' reservation history. Users can comment on the restaurants as well.<br>
A similar web site could be OpenTable <br>
**Data the project will store and show:** restaurant list, restaurant comments, user reservation history (including friend reservation history), friend list <br>
**Interactive element:** Users can comment on the restaurants, so the comments can also be showed to the public.
