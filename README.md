# Job posting Database Project

I found a dataset of job posts, with columns job id, company name (but they are fake), industry, job position, required major and degree, years of working experience and miles from metropolis. I plan to use these information to create a job posting database application. The similar website is Indeed. I re-wrote project proposal because the data inside job posting dataset are sufficient and large enough.

Some possible features for this project: input key words, including job position, company name, major and degree can find relevant job information. Input job position associated with miles from metropolis or working experience can find relevant job information.
